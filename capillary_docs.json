APIs.\nCapillary APIs are structured following the REST model. Our APIs use HTTPS protocol and support requests and responses in JSON format.\nHTTP methods\nThe HTTP methods used in Capillary APIs are as follows:\nKnow about API URL structure, host URL and headers\nAPI URL structure\nThe below image displays Capillary API structure with an example:\nThe resource ID is a combination of the Entity and the action you tell the API to perform. In this case, adding a customer is the entity and add is the action. For more information on entities, see Entities management .\nHost URLs\nA host is a server to which the API calls are made, usually the API cluster URL.\nThe host URLs are the same for both v1.1, v2, and v3 APIs. However, the v1 APIs mentioned in the documentation have different URLs for each entity. You can see those URLs under the respective section.\nRequest Headers\nHeader\nDescription\nValue\nAccept\nRequest format from the server side\napplication/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format\nContent-Type\nRepresentation of data at the client side.\napplication/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format\nUser-Agent\nA characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.\nFormat \\{product\\} {product-version} \\{comment\\} Example: User-Agent: Mozilla\\{version\\} ({system-information}) \\{platform\\} ({platform-details}) \\{extensions\\}\nCAP-API-ACCESS-TOKEN\nUnique access token generated with the Key and Secret combination. Applicable for OAuth based authentication.\nGenerated token value.\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE\nTill or store from which you want to post the data. This is applicable for the OAuth authentication only.\nTILL, STORE_CODE, STORE_NAME, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_1, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_2. The default value is TILL .\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE\nValue of the specified entity type.\nExample: If X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE is STORE_CODE , then X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE is the store code that you want to tag to POST data. By default, it considers the Till associated with the client key and secret.\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP-TYPE: \\{name} X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP: \\{value}\nSupported only for v2 APIs: Lets you submit requests on behalf of other TILLs (active TILLs) instead of the authenticating till. In db, the combination of attribution_lookup and lookup_code are mapped to TILL ids and org ids. When a new POST request is placed with the combination of a lookup name and lookup code, the data will be inserted in the db on behalf of the TILL that is mapped to the specified combination.\nNOTE: * It is recommended to use OAuth authentication.\nAccepted values are WECHAT and MOBILE_TRIGGER.\nResponse headers\nParameter\nDescription\nX-Cap-Requestid\nA unique ID generated for every promotional request. This ID is sent in the response headers and can be used to track the request and its response end-to-end. For batch transactions, this ID tracks the entire API call, including all promotions processed within the batch.\nx-cap-api-request-uri\nThis standardises endpoint identification by exposing the URI pattern in a response header instead of the raw URI, enabling cleaner metrics, better observability, and easier debugging. Example: Request → GET /v1/promotions/customer/12345 Response header → x-cap-api-request-uri: /v1/promotions/customer/customerId\nAPI version\nCapillary's APIs are divided into four versions:\nv1\nv1.1\nv2\nv3\nThese versions are not merely upgrades; they are a combination of:\nnew sets of APIs that receive new version numbers, and\nupgraded versions of existing APIs.\nThe v1 APIs support both JSON and XML. The V2 and V3 APIs are developed in JSON.\nAdditional features of v2 and v3 APIs\nThe list below highlights the additional features that v2 and v3 APIs support compared to v1 and v1.1 APIs:\nProvide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\nProvide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\nSupport multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls.\nSupport multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls.\nMerge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using his mobile number and e-commerce site using his email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID. You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID.\nMerge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources.

You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID.\nNOTE: By default, all the API versions are enabled for the organisations across clusters.\nOrganization setup\nAn organization associated with Capillary is registered in Intouch.

APIs.\nCapillary APIs are structured following the REST model. Our APIs use HTTPS protocol and support requests and responses in JSON format.\nHTTP methods\nThe HTTP methods used in Capillary APIs are as follows:\nKnow about API URL structure, host URL and headers\nAPI URL structure\nThe below image displays Capillary API structure with an example:\nThe resource ID is a combination of the Entity and the action you tell the API to perform. In this case, adding a customer is the entity and add is the action. For more information on entities, see Entities management .\nHost URLs\nA host is a server to which the API calls are made, usually the API cluster URL.\nThe host URLs are the same for both v1.1, v2, and v3 APIs. However, the v1 APIs mentioned in the documentation have different URLs for each entity. You can see those URLs under the respective section.\nRequest Headers\nHeader\nDescription\nValue\nAccept\nRequest format from the server side\napplication/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format\nContent-Type\nRepresentation of data at the client side.\napplication/json for JSON format application/xml for XML format\nUser-Agent\nA characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.\nFormat \\{product\\} {product-version} \\{comment\\} Example: User-Agent: Mozilla\\{version\\} ({system-information}) \\{platform\\} ({platform-details}) \\{extensions\\}\nCAP-API-ACCESS-TOKEN\nUnique access token generated with the Key and Secret combination. Applicable for OAuth based authentication.\nGenerated token value.\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE\nTill or store from which you want to post the data. This is applicable for the OAuth authentication only.\nTILL, STORE_CODE, STORE_NAME, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_1, STORE_EXTERNAL_ID_2. The default value is TILL .\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE\nValue of the specified entity type.\nExample: If X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-TYPE is STORE_CODE , then X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-ENTITY-CODE is the store code that you want to tag to POST data. By default, it considers the Till associated with the client key and secret.\nX-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP-TYPE: \\{name} X-CAP-API-ATTRIBUTION-LOOKUP: \\{value}\nSupported only for v2 APIs: Lets you submit requests on behalf of other TILLs (active TILLs) instead of the authenticating till. In db, the combination of attribution_lookup and lookup_code are mapped to TILL ids and org ids. When a new POST request is placed with the combination of a lookup name and lookup code, the data will be inserted in the db on behalf of the TILL that is mapped to the specified combination.\nNOTE: * It is recommended to use OAuth authentication.\nAccepted values are WECHAT and MOBILE_TRIGGER.\nResponse headers\nParameter\nDescription\nX-Cap-Requestid\nA unique ID generated for every promotional request. This ID is sent in the response headers and can be used to track the request and its response end-to-end. For batch transactions, this ID tracks the entire API call, including all promotions processed within the batch.\nx-cap-api-request-uri\nThis standardises endpoint identification by exposing the URI pattern in a response header instead of the raw URI, enabling cleaner metrics, better observability, and easier debugging. Example: Request → GET /v1/promotions/customer/12345 Response header → x-cap-api-request-uri: /v1/promotions/customer/customerId\nAPI version\nCapillary's APIs are divided into four versions:\nv1\nv1.1\nv2\nv3\nThese versions are not merely upgrades; they are a combination of:\nnew sets of APIs that receive new version numbers, and\nupgraded versions of existing APIs.\nThe v1 APIs support both JSON and XML. The V2 and V3 APIs are developed in JSON.\nAdditional features of v2 and v3 APIs\nThe list below highlights the additional features that v2 and v3 APIs support compared to v1 and v1.1 APIs:\nProvide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\nProvide extended support for multiple sources, i.e., you can now manage accounts of different sources such as InStore, MartJack, WeChat, e-commerce and Facebook.\nSupport multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls.\nSupport multiple accounts of a single source. For example, an org could have multiple accounts on WeChat and Facebook. Each account will have a different account ID. You would need to pass the respective account ID when making API calls.\nMerge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using his mobile number and e-commerce site using his email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID. You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID.\nMerge accounts automatically when the same identifier is registered in different sources. For example, assume that a customer has registered on InStore using his mobile number and e-commerce site using his email ID. Now, if the customer registers the same mobile number on the e-commerce site, the accounts will be merged automatically to a single customer ID. You can retrieve the customer details from various sources of an organization using the unique customer ID.\nNOTE: By default, all the API versions are enabled for the organisations across clusters.\nOrganization setup\nAn organization associated with Capillary is registered in Intouch. Based on the organization’s architecture, store TILL or Store Center accounts are created besides zones, concepts, and stores. Only Capillary users have access to register an organization in inTouch. For more information, contact your Account Manager or Delivery Manager of Capillary.\nTo set up an organization as a Capillary admin, see Setting up Organization .\nTable of Contents\nHTTP methods Know about API URL structure, host URL and headers API URL structure Host URLs Request Headers Response headers API version Additional features of v2 and v3 APIs Organization setup\nHTTP methods\nKnow about API URL structure, host URL and headers\nAPI URL structure Host URLs Request Headers Response headers\nAPI URL structure\nHost URLs\nRequest Headers\nResponse headers\nAPI version\nAdditional features of v2 and v3 APIs\nAdditional features of v2 and v3 APIs\nOrganization setup"
